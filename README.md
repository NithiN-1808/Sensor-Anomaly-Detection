# Sensor-Anomaly-Detection

Anomaly detection is a crucial task in identifying rare events in time series data. This repository provides a collection of methods to detect anomalies using various machine learning models like LSTM Autoencoders, DBSCAN, One-Class SVM, and Isolation Forest.

## **Project Overview**
This project implements anomaly detection on time series data using multiple models and compares their performances. It leverages machine learning techniques such as:
- LSTM Autoencoders for reconstruction-based anomaly detection.
- DBSCAN for density-based anomaly detection.
- One-Class SVM and Isolation Forest for outlier detection.

## **Installation and Setup**
